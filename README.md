## How To Play:
When the game begins, a random 5-letter word will be chosen:

You will have a certain amount of attempts to guess the word based on the selected difficulty.
Once you enter a guess, the gameboard will refresh and each letter of your guess will change:
- ðŸŸ© GREEN ðŸŸ© : The letter and position of letter are correct.
- ðŸŸ¨ YELLOW ðŸŸ¨ : The letter is correct, but not the position.
- â¬› Gray â¬›: The letter is incorrect and not in the word.
